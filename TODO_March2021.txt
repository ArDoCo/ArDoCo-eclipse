TODO March 2021:

- In textAnalysis.core.Delegate handle setting of directory and file name for the creating of tap and taf files
(currently hardcorded in method launch).
- Inspect creation of taf files (build on tap files which are successfully created, taf file not).

- In textAnnotation.annotationplugin.wizards.ProfileWizards in doFinishWithoutContainer() handle case if file already exists.
- Implement creation of annotation classes independent from UI (not working yet becasue of missing container).
- Resolve error occurring concerning the _analysis.xml and _error.xml files.
